    <p><a href="#">Amongst the hundreds of thousands of symbols which are
      in the unicode text specifications are certain characters which resemble,
      or are variations of the alphabet and other keyword symbols.
      For example, if we can take the phrase "thug life" and convert its
      characters into the fancy letters "thug life" which are a set of
      unicode symbols. These different sets of fancy text letters are
      scattered all throughout the unicode specification, and so to create
      a fancy text translator, it's just a matter of finding these sets of
      letters and symbols, and linking them to their normal alphabetical
      equivalents.</a></p>
